                <p>
                    I ask them to take a poem and hold it up to the light like a color slide or press an ear against its
                    hive. I say drop a mouse into a poem and watch him probe his way out, or walk inside the poem’s room
                    and feel the walls for a light switch.I Continue reading “Introduction to Poetry”

                <p>
                    When some people talk about moneyThey speak as if it were a mysterious loverWho went out to buy milk
                    and
                    neverCame back, and it makes me nostalgicFor the years I lived on coffee and bread,Hungry all the
                    time,
                    walking to work on paydayLike a woman journeying for waterFrom a village without a well, then
                    livingOne

                <p>
                    Thanks for the tree between me & a sniper’s bullet. I don’t know what made the grass sway seconds
                    before
                    the Viet Cong raised his soundless rifle. Some voice always followed, telling me which foot to put
                    down
                    first. Thanks for deflecting the ricochet against that anarchy of dusk. I was back in San Francisco
